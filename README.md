## Introduction
Braitenberg Vehicles (which we also refer to as Robots) are the thought experiments of Valentino Braitenberg, who imagined complex behavior emerging from design. His vehicles exhibit aggression, fear, exploration, and love through sensor-motor connections. 

## Overview
The overall goal of the software project is to develop a rudimentary robot simulator in which robot behavior is visualized within a graphics window, and to set up, observe, and document the results of experiments involving the entities in the simulator. The robots will be modeled after Braitenberg Vehicles, which use a design to realize complex behavior. The environment will have multiple robots, as well as stimuli such as lights and food. Robots will exhibit different behavior when they sense the stimuli in the environment, depending on their sensor-motor connections related to that stimulus. For example, some robots will be attracted to the light and some fear the light.
